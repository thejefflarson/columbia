    <p>It's probably time to start thinking about final projects. For these
      final six weeks, we'll have three more homework assignments, and we're
      going to shift to Raster based GIS, which personally, I find more
      exciting. I hope you do too.</p>
    <p class="pb2">Before we go, we'll cover two algorithms that can help you find stories
      in data, kmeans and DBSCAN. We'll cover them in class, but the wonderful
      <a class="dark-red" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit learn</a> library has
      both of them, and is probably much faster than below.
    <p class="pb2">Oh also, I stumbled across <a class="dark-red" href="http://epsg.io/">epsg.io</a>
      which is a better Spatial Reference, in that it only includes official
      projections.</p>

    <h2 class="bb fw3 f1 lh-title mb3">Clustering with K-Means</h2>
    <p class="pb2"><a class="dark-red" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means">K-means</a> is a simple and unsupervised algorithm that can find clusters in
      point data very quickly. It does this by assigning each point to the
      cluster with the nearest center, and then repeating the process.</p>
    <p class="pb2">While straightforward, it relies on you guessing ahead of time how many
      clusters you think there are, so it's not super helpful in exploring a
      dataset, or finding stories in one.</p>

    <p class="pb2"><a class="dark-red" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.html">DBSCAN</a> is a slick algorithm that doesn't rely on you knowing how many clusters

      radius, and a minumum number of neighbours. It's also a bit easier to
