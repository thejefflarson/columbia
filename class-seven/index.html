    <h2>Update</h2>
    <p>It's probably time to start thinking about final projects. For these
      final six weeks, we'll have three more homework assignments, and we're
      going to shift to Raster based GIS, which personally, I find more
      exciting. I hope you do too</p>
    <p>Oh also, I stumbled across <a href="http://epsg.io/">epsg.io</a>
      which is a better Spatial Reference, in that it only includes official
      projections.</p>
