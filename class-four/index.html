    <p class="pv2">Send me an <a href="mailto:jal2301@columbia.edu" class="link dim yellow">
      email
    </a> containing:
      <ol class="measure-wide pl2">
        <li>1. The list of foreclosures if you found them, if not an email you
          sent and subsequent correspondence, if any, asking about them.
        </li>
        <li>2. An image of your chloropleth race breakdown.</li>
        <li>3. Your dots function in python.</li>

    <p class="pv2">If Shapely and or Fiona are giving you issues reinstall them with:</p>

pip uninstall fiona shapely && pip install --no-use-wheel shapely fiona</pre>
    <h2 class="fw1 f3 mv3 bb ttu lh-title gold tracked">Clipping Polygons</h2>
    <p class="pv2 measure-wide">
      A few of you have asked me how to do this, and these are the simplest ways
      to cut features to a boundary polygon. First with ogr:
    </p>
    <pre class="code pa2 bg-mid-gray">
ogr2ogr clipped.shp source.shp -clipsrc boundary.shp</pre>
    <p class="pv2 measure-wide">
      And in Fiona and Shapely:
    </p>
    <pre class="code pa2 bg-mid-gray">
import fiona
import sys
from shapely.geometry import shape, mapping
from shapely.ops import cascaded_union

with fiona.drivers():
    with fiona.open(sys.argv[1]) as source:
        with fiona.open(sys.argv[2]) as clip:
            dest = fiona.open(sys.argv[3], 'w',
                              driver=source.driver,
                              crs=source.crs,
                              schema=source.schema)
            # convert clip into a list of shapely shapes
            clippers = [shape(s['geometry']) for s in clip]
            for feature in source:
                clipped = []
                geometry = shape(feature['geometry'])
                for clipper in clippers:
                    if clipper.intersects(geometry):
                        clipped.append(clipper.intersection(geometry))

                if clipped:
                    unioned = cascaded_union(clipped)
                    # Sometimes an intersection can return a point
                    # or a linestring
                    if unioned.type == geometry.type:
                        dest.write({
                            'geometry': mapping(unioned),
                            'properties': feature['properties']

    <h2 class="fw1 f3 mv3 bb ttu lh-title gold tracked">Working with associated data in Fiona</h2>
    <p class="pv2 measure-wide">
      This week we're going to try and find a story, first we're going to use a
      simple index called the dissimilarity index to measure segregation in
      Brooklyn.
    </p>
    $$dissimilarity = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left | \frac{b_i}{B_i} - \frac{w_i}{W_i} \right |$$
    <p class="pv2 measure-wide">
      Essentially, it is the percentage of people who would have to move out of
      the tract they live in so that all tracts have the same racial breakdown as
      Brooklyn as a whole. Here's one way to do it on a shapefile with
      demographics:
    </p>
    <pre class="code pa2 bg-mid-gray">
import fiona


with fiona.drivers():
    with fiona.open('brooklyn-demos.shp') as source:
        props = [s['properties'] for s in source]

# filter out missing data
props = list(filter(lambda x: x.get('black') and x.get('white') and x.get('total_nonh') > 0, props))

# Calculate totals
total = {'black': 0.0, 'white': 0.0, 'total': 0.0}
for prop in props:
    total['black'] += prop['black']
    total['white'] += prop['white']
    total['total'] += prop['total_nonh']

index = 0.0
for prop in props:
    index += abs(prop['black'] / total['black'] - prop['white'] / total['white'])

print(0.5 * index * 100)
    </pre>
    <p class="pv2 measure-wide">
      So, Brooklyn is pretty segregated between blacks and whites.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw1 f3 mv3 bb ttu lh-title gold tracked">A possible story</h2>
    <p class="pv2 measure-wide">
      Last week, someone asked if foreclosure data was in the census,
      unfortunately it isn't. However, there are numbers on housing
      characteristics. Let's see if there's a visual correlation between
      African American tracts and vacant housing. To do that, we're going to
      create a simple
      <a href="http://andywoodruff.com/blog/value-by-alpha-maps/" class="link dim yellow">
        Value by Alpha Map</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw1 f3 mv3 bb ttu lh-title gold tracked">Testing our Hypothesis With a Regression</h2>
    <p class="pv2 measure-wide">
      Generally when we have a hypothesis, it's our job to try and prove
      ourselves wrong. The best way to do that is to see if we can explain
      away a perceived effect by controlling for other variables, and
      for that we turn to a regression. We'll use
      <a href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/regression.html" class="link dim yellow">StatsModels</a>,
      <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" class="link dim yellow">Pandas</a>,
      and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/" class="link dim yellow">matplotlib</a>.
    </p>
    <pre class="code pa2 bg-mid-gray">
import fiona
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


with fiona.drivers():
    with fiona.open('brooklyn-demos.shp') as source:
        props = [s['properties'] for s in source]


# filter out missing data
df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(props)

features = df[['percent_va', 'p_black', 'median_inc']].dropna()

plt.scatter(features['p_black'], features['percent_va'],)
plt.savefig('out.png')

print(features.describe())

model = sm.OLS(features['percent_va'], features[['p_black']])

    <h2 class="fw1 f3 mv3 bb ttu lh-title gold tracked">Homework</h2>
    <p class="pv2 measure-wide">
      The homework this week has two parts:
      <ol>
        <li class="measure-wide">
          1. Calculate the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/21/diversity-index-data-how-we-did-report/17432103/" class="link dim yellow">USA Today diversity index</a>
          for your county. If you're county is has too few tracts,
          try your state. You don't need a joined shapefile for this
          you can do it just with ACS data. You'll need to email me your code.
        </li>
        <li class="measure-wide">
          2. Turn one of the datasets on the bottom <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-lien-sales.page" class="link dim yellow">here</a>
          into a shapefile of points using Shapely, Fiona, and Mapzen's <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/" class="link dim yellow">Geocoding api</a>.
          If you were able to get address data for foreclosures last week,
          you should use your data instead.
          In order to get the data out cleanly you'll want to try <a href="http://tabula.technology/" class="link dim yellow">Tabula</a>.
          Tip: You'll want to have a look at <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/" class="link dim yellow">Requests</a> to make the HTTP requests.
        </li>
        <li class="measure-wide">
          3. Use either <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html" class="link dim yellow">KNN</a> or
          <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html" class="link dim yellow">KMeans</a> from <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/" class="link dim yellow">Scikit learn</a> to cluster the geocoded addresses and write them to a shapefile then open that in QGIS and send me a screenshot of your clusters.
      </ol>
      <p class="pv2 measure-wide">
        Next week! Putting making things for the web I promise!
